              <p>Austin City Powersports is a local, family-owned motorcycle and scooter full service dealer. I was tasked with building them a clean and simple website to promote their business and to serve their customers. The ease of navigation was their main concern, for their loyal older clientele, but they also wanted to appeal to the younger demographic as they were starting to sell more scooters.</p>

              <p>The Zombie Run is an annual 5k with a terrifying theme! As you run you are chased by zombies. This is a fun new take for pretty established marathon scene, with potential to attract a whole new demographic to that scene. The site was meant to be scary (while maintaining appeal), without too much clutter to distract from the registration and volunteer links. </p>
